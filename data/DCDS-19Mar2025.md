Adapted from the shell-novice lesson plan from [Software Carpentries](https://github.com/swcarpentry/shell-novice/tree/main)

### Meet The Shell

Let's get started.

When the shell is first opened, you are presented with a **prompt**,
indicating that the shell is waiting for input.

```bash
$
```

The shell typically uses `$ ` as the prompt, but may use a different symbol.
In the examples for this lesson, we'll show the prompt as `$ `.
Most importantly, *do not type the prompt* when typing commands.
Only type the command that follows the prompt.
This rule applies both in these lessons and in lessons from other sources.
Also note that after you type a command, you have to press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to execute it.

An example prompt from my screen:

```bash
Jananis-Air:~ jananihariharan$ 
```

## ls : List contents of a directory

```bash
$ ls
```

## Nelle's Pipeline: A Typical Problem

Nelle Nemo, a marine biologist, has just returned from a six-month survey of the
[North Pacific Gyre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pacific_Gyre),
where she has been sampling gelatinous marine life in the
[Great Pacific Garbage Patch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pacific_Garbage_Patch).

She has 1520 samples that she's run through an assay machine to measure the relative abundance of 300 proteins.

She needs to run these 1520 files through an imaginary program called `goostats.sh`.
In addition to this huge task, she has to write up results by the end of the month, 
so her paper can appear in a special issue of *Aquatic Goo Letters*.

If Nelle chooses to run `goostats.sh` by hand using a GUI, she'll have to select and open a file 1520 times.
If `goostats.sh` takes 30 seconds to run each file, the whole process will take more than 12 hours
of Nelle's attention.
With the shell, Nelle can instead assign her computer this mundane task while she focuses
her attention on writing her paper.

As a bonus,
once she has put a processing pipeline together,
she will be able to use it again whenever she collects more data.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- A shell is a program whose primary purpose is to read commands and run other programs.
- This lesson uses Bash, the default shell in many implementations of Unix.
- Programs can be run in Bash by entering commands at the command-line prompt.
- The shell's main advantages are its support for automating repetitive tasks, and its capacity to access networked machines.
- A significant challenge when using the shell can be knowing what commands need to be run and how to run them.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Where am I? : pwd

```Sample output
/Users/jananihariharan
```

This is my **home directory**

## Slashes

Notice that there are two meanings for the `/` character.
When it appears at the front of a file or directory name,
it refers to the root directory. When it appears *inside* a path,
it's just a separator.

## Playing around with ls

ls -l
ls -la
ls -r
ls -F
ls -S
ls -F Desktop

## Getting help

```bash
  $ ls --help
  ```

```bash
  $ man ls
  ```
## Challenge #1
List the contents of the folder (directory) you just downloaded, "shell-lesson-data", from your home directory.

## Changing directories: cd

```bash
$ cd Desktop
$ cd shell-lesson-data
$ cd exercise-data
```

What happens if you run these commands now?

```bash
$ pwd
```

```bash
$ ls -F
```

We now know how to go down the directory tree (i.e. how to go into a subdirectory),
but how do we go up (i.e. how do we leave a directory and go into its parent directory)?
We might try the following:

```bash
$ cd shell-lesson-data
```

```error
-bash: cd: shell-lesson-data: No such file or directory
```

But we get an error! Why is this?

Let's try returning to the `exercise-data` directory from before. Last time, we used
three commands, but we can actually string together the list of directories
to move to `exercise-data` in one step:

```bash
$ cd Desktop/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data
```

Check that we've moved to the right place by running `pwd` and `ls -F`.

## File Paths: Make or Break!

```bash
$ pwd
```

```output
/Users/nelle/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data
```

```bash
$ cd /Users/nelle/Desktop/shell-lesson-data
```

This is called an ##absolute path.

Paths can be relative too!

The shell interprets a tilde (`~`) character at the start of a path to
mean "the current user's home directory".

`cd` will translate `-` into *the previous directory I was in*, 
which is faster than having to remember, then type, the full path. 
This is a *very* efficient way of moving
*back and forth between two directories* -- i.e. if you execute `cd -` twice,
you end up back in the starting directory.

cd .. : brings you UP
cd - : brings you BACK

## Absolute vs Relative Paths

Starting from `/Users/nelle/data`,
which of the following commands could Nelle use to navigate to her home directory,
which is `/Users/nelle`?

1. `cd .`
2. `cd /`
3. `cd /home/nelle`
4. `cd ../..`
5. `cd ~`
6. `cd home`
7. `cd ~/data/..`
8. `cd`
9. `cd ..`

## Essential Shell terminology

Consider the command below as a general example of a command,
which we will dissect into its component parts:

```bash
$ ls -F /
```

`ls` is the **command**, with an **option** `-F` and an
**argument** `/`.

```bash
$ cd ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data
$ ls -s exercise-data
```

```output
total 28
 4 animal-counts   4 creatures  12 numbers.txt   4 alkanes   4 writing
```

Note that the sizes returned by `ls -s` are in *blocks*.
As these are defined differently for different operating systems,
you may not obtain the same figures as in the example.

```bash
$ ls -S exercise-data
```

```output
animal-counts  creatures  alkanes  writing  numbers.txt
```

### Nelle's Pipeline: Organizing Files

Knowing this much about files and directories,
Nelle is ready to organize the files from the protein assay machine.

She creates a directory called `north-pacific-gyre`
(to remind herself where the data came from),
which will contain the data files from the machine
and her data processing scripts.

Each of her physical samples is labelled according to her lab's convention
with a unique ten-character ID,
such as 'NENE01729A'.
This ID is what she used in her collection log
to record the location, time, depth, and other characteristics of the sample.
Since the output of the assay machine is plain text,
she will call her files `NENE01729A.txt`, `NENE01812A.txt`, and so on.
All 1520 files will go into the same directory.

Now in her current directory `shell-lesson-data`,
Nelle can see what files she has using the command:

```bash
$ ls north-pacific-gyre/
```

This command is a lot to type,
but she can let the shell do most of the work through what is called **tab completion**.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Information is stored in files, which are stored in directories (folders).
- Directories can also store other directories, which then form a directory tree.
- `pwd` prints the user's current working directory.
- `ls [path]` prints a listing of a specific file or directory; `ls` on its own lists the current working directory.
- `cd [path]` changes the current working directory.
- Most commands take options that begin with a single `-`.
- Directory names in a path are separated with `/` on Unix, but `\` on Windows.
- `/` on its own is the root directory of the whole file system.
- An absolute path specifies a location from the root of the file system.
- A relative path specifies a location starting from the current location.
- `.` on its own means 'the current directory'; `..` means 'the directory above the current one'.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Creating Directories and Files: mkdir and nano or touch

Let's move to the `exercise-data/writing` directory and see what it contains:

Let's create a new directory called `thesis` using the command `mkdir thesis`
(which has no output):

```bash
$ mkdir thesis
```

mkdir is a powerful command! Try this:

```bash
$ mkdir -p ../project/data ../project/results
```

What does this command do?

```bash
$ ls -FR ../project
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout
Let's talk about good file naming practices for the command line. 

Let's change our working directory to `thesis` using `cd`,
then run a text editor called Nano to create a file called `draft.txt`:

```bash
$ cd thesis
$ nano draft.txt
```

#if this command produces an error, you may not have the Nano program installed. Try <a href="https://gist.github.com/GLMeece/94b8dcc20b9785d5b783ba5498b52fdf">this link.</a>

We have seen how to create text files using the `nano` editor.
Now, try the following command:

```bash
$ touch my_file.txt
```

1. What did the `touch` command do?
  When you look at your current directory using the GUI file explorer,
  does the file show up?

2. Use `ls -l` to inspect the files.  How large is `my_file.txt`?

3. When might you want to create a file this way?

## Deleting a File: rm

To avoid confusion later on, let's remove the dummy file we just created. 
To do this, use the following command:

```bash
$ rm my_file.txt
```

## Moving files and directories : mv

Returning to the `shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/writing` directory,

```bash
$ cd ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/writing
```

In our `thesis` directory we have a file `draft.txt`
which isn't a particularly informative name,
so let's change the file's name using `mv`,
which is short for 'move':

```bash
$ mv thesis/draft.txt thesis/quotes.txt
```

## Caution: 
`mv` will silently overwrite any existing file with the same name, 
which could lead to data loss. By default, `mv` will not ask for confirmation before overwriting files.
However, an additional option, `mv -i` (or `mv --interactive`), will cause `mv` to request
such confirmation.

Let's move `quotes.txt` into the current working directory.
We use `mv` once again,
but this time we'll use just the name of a directory as the second argument
to tell `mv` that we want to keep the filename
but put the file somewhere new.
(This is why the command is called 'move'.)
In this case,
the directory name we use is the special directory name `.` that we mentioned earlier.

```bash
$ mv thesis/quotes.txt .
```

## Challenge: Moving Files to a new folder

After running the following commands,
Nelle realizes that she put the files `sucrose.dat` and `maltose.dat` into the wrong folder.
The files should have been placed in the `raw` folder.

```bash
$ ls -F
 analyzed/ raw/
$ ls -F analyzed
fructose.dat glucose.dat maltose.dat sucrose.dat
$ cd analyzed
```

Fill in the blanks to move these files to the `raw/` folder
(i.e. the one she forgot to put them in)

```bash
$ mv sucrose.dat maltose.dat ____/____
```

## Copying files and directories : cp

```bash
$ cp quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt
$ ls quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt
```

We can also copy a directory and all its contents by using the
[recursive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion) option `-r`,
e.g. to back up a directory:

```bash
$ cp -r thesis thesis_backup
```

Why is the -r option important? Try this command:

```bash
$ cp thesis thesis_backup
```

## Challenge: Renaming Files

Suppose that you created a plain-text file in your current directory to contain a list of the
statistical tests you will need to do to analyze your data, and named it `statstics.txt`

After creating and saving this file you realize you misspelled the filename! You want to
correct the mistake, which of the following commands could you use to do so?

1. `cp statstics.txt statistics.txt`
2. `mv statstics.txt statistics.txt`
3. `mv statstics.txt .`
4. `cp statstics.txt .`

## Challenge: Moving versus Copying

What is the output of the closing `ls` command in the sequence shown below?

```bash
$ pwd
```

```output
/Users/jamie/data
```

```bash
$ ls
```

```output
proteins.dat
```

```bash
$ mkdir recombined
$ mv proteins.dat recombined/
$ cp recombined/proteins.dat ../proteins-saved.dat
$ ls
```

1. `proteins-saved.dat recombined`
2. `recombined`
3. `proteins.dat recombined`
4. `proteins-saved.dat`

## Removing files and directories

Returning to the `shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/writing` directory,
let's tidy up this directory by removing the `quotes.txt` file we created.

```bash
$ rm quotes.txt
```

Let's confirm that the file is gone using `ls`:

```bash
$ ls quotes.txt
```

```error
ls: cannot access 'quotes.txt': No such file or directory
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Using `rm` Safely

What happens when we execute `rm -i thesis_backup/quotations.txt`?
Why would we want this protection when using `rm`?

## Deleting Is Forever!!!

The Unix shell doesn't have a trash bin that we can recover deleted
files from (though most graphical interfaces to Unix do).  Instead,
when we delete files, they are unlinked from the file system so that
their storage space on disk can be recycled. Tools for finding and
recovering deleted files do exist, but there's no guarantee they'll
work in any particular situation, since the computer may recycle the
file's disk space right away. 

If we try to remove the `thesis` directory using `rm thesis`,
we get an error message:

```bash
$ rm thesis
```

```error
rm: cannot remove 'thesis': Is a directory
```

This happens because `rm` by default only works on files, not directories.

`rm` can remove a directory *and all its contents* if we use the
recursive option `-r`, and it will do so *without any confirmation prompts*:

```bash
$ rm -r thesis
```

Given that there is no way to retrieve files deleted using the shell,
## `rm -r` *should be used with great caution*
(you might consider adding the interactive option `rm -r -i`).

## Challenge: Copy with Multiple Filenames

For this exercise, you can test the commands in the `shell-lesson-data/exercise-data` directory.

In the example below, what does `cp` do when given several filenames and a directory name?

```bash
$ mkdir backup
$ cp creatures/minotaur.dat creatures/unicorn.dat backup/
```

In the example below, what does `cp` do when given three or more file names?

```bash
$ cd creatures
$ ls -F
```

```output
basilisk.dat  minotaur.dat  unicorn.dat
```

```bash
$ cp minotaur.dat unicorn.dat basilisk.dat
```

## Wildcards

`*` is a **wildcard**, which represents zero or more other characters.
Let's consider the `shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/alkanes` directory:
`*.pdb` represents `ethane.pdb`, `propane.pdb`, and every
file that ends with '.pdb'. On the other hand, `p*.pdb` only represents
`pentane.pdb` and `propane.pdb`, because the 'p' at the front can only
represent filenames that begin with the letter 'p'.

`?` is also a wildcard, but it represents exactly one character.
So `?ethane.pdb` could represent `methane.pdb` whereas
`*ethane.pdb` represents both `ethane.pdb` and `methane.pdb`.

Wildcards can be used in combination with each other. For example,
`???ane.pdb` indicates three characters followed by `ane.pdb`,
giving `cubane.pdb  ethane.pdb  octane.pdb`.

## Challenge: Organizing Directories and Files

Nelle is working on her project, and she sees that her files aren't very well
organized:

```bash
$ ls -F
```

```output
analyzed/  fructose.dat    raw/   sucrose.dat
```

The `fructose.dat` and `sucrose.dat` files contain output from her data
analysis. What command(s) covered in this lesson does she need to run
so that the commands below will produce the output shown?

```bash
$ ls -F
```

```output
analyzed/   raw/
```

```bash
$ ls analyzed
```

```output
fructose.dat    sucrose.dat
```

## Reproduce a folder structure

You're starting a new experiment and would like to duplicate the directory
structure from your previous experiment so you can add new data.

Assume that the previous experiment is in a folder called `2016-05-18`,
which contains a `data` folder that in turn contains folders named `raw` and
`processed` that contain data files.  The goal is to copy the folder structure
of the `2016-05-18` folder into a folder called `2016-05-20`
so that your final directory structure looks like this:

```output
2016-05-20/
└── data
   ├── processed
   └── raw
```

Which of the following set of commands would achieve this objective?
What would the other commands do?

```bash
$ mkdir 2016-05-20
$ mkdir 2016-05-20/data
$ mkdir 2016-05-20/data/processed
$ mkdir 2016-05-20/data/raw
```

```bash
$ mkdir 2016-05-20
$ cd 2016-05-20
$ mkdir data
$ cd data
$ mkdir raw processed
```

```bash
$ mkdir 2016-05-20/data/raw
$ mkdir 2016-05-20/data/processed
```

```bash
$ mkdir -p 2016-05-20/data/raw
$ mkdir -p 2016-05-20/data/processed
```

```bash
$ mkdir 2016-05-20
$ cd 2016-05-20
$ mkdir data
$ mkdir raw processed
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- `cp [old] [new]` copies a file.
- `mkdir [path]` creates a new directory.
- `mv [old] [new]` moves (renames) a file or directory.
- `rm [path]` removes (deletes) a file.
- `*` matches zero or more characters in a filename, so `*.txt` matches all files ending in `.txt`.
- `?` matches any single character in a filename, so `?.txt` matches `a.txt` but not `any.txt`.
- The shell does not have a trash bin: once something is deleted, it's really gone.
- Most files' names are `something.extension`. The extension isn't required, and doesn't guarantee anything, but is normally used to indicate the type of data in the file.
- Depending on the type of work you do, you may need a more powerful text editor than Nano.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

I'll leave you with a few more commands to start exploring the power of the shell:

## Counting the number of words in a file: wc

```bash
$ ls ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/alkanes
$ wc cubane.pdb
```

Now try:

```bash
$ wc *.pdb
```

## Capturing output from commands

Which of these files contains the fewest lines?
It's an easy question to answer when there are only six files,
but what if there were 6000?
Our first step toward a solution is to run the command:

```bash
$ wc -l *.pdb > lengths.txt
```

## Challenge: Sorting files : sort

The file `shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/numbers.txt` contains the following lines:

```source
10
2
19
22
6
```

If we run `sort` on this file, the output is:

```output
10
19
2
22
6
```

If we run `sort -n` on the same file, we get this instead:

```output
2
6
10
19
22
```

Explain why `-n` has this effect.

What happens if you do this?

```bash
$ sort -n lengths.txt
```

Once we've done that,
we can run another command called `head` to get the first few lines in `sorted-lengths.txt`:

```bash
$ sort -n lengths.txt > sorted-lengths.txt
$ head -n 1 sorted-lengths.txt
```

## Final Challenge: Making Heads and Tails of a File

Consider the file `shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/animal-counts/animals.csv`.
After these commands, select the answer that
corresponds to the file `animals-subset.csv`:

```bash
$ head -n 3 animals.csv > animals-subset.csv
$ tail -n 2 animals.csv >> animals-subset.csv
```

1. The first three lines of `animals.csv`
2. The last two lines of `animals.csv`
3. The first three lines and the last two lines of `animals.csv`
4. The second and third lines of `animals.csv`
&emsp;
&emsp;
&emsp;
&emsp;
&emsp;
&emsp;
Still reading? OK, here's a (super cool) bonus:

## The Pipe!

In our example of finding the file with the fewest lines,
we are using two intermediate files `lengths.txt` and `sorted-lengths.txt` to store output.
This is a confusing way to work because
even once you understand what `wc`, `sort`, and `head` do,
those intermediate files make it hard to follow what's going on.
We can make it easier to understand by running `sort` and `head` together:

```bash
$ sort -n lengths.txt | head -n 1
```

```output
  9  methane.pdb
```

The vertical bar, `|`, between the two commands is called a **pipe**.
It tells the shell that we want to use
the output of the command on the left
as the input to the command on the right.

This has removed the need for the `sorted-lengths.txt` file.

The pipe is incredibly powerful because it lets you combine multiple commands and write the output to a single file -- a data analysis win!
